## School

✾ I'm graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Human Systems Engineering with a User Experience concentration ✾ and I've gotten more interested in front-end development throughout my classes. I've been recognized with the Outstanding Graduate award for my graduating class and will graduate *summa cum laude.*

## Programming
I am new to HTML and CSS but am learning a lot and am excited at the idea of the possibility of learning new languages.  I want to be a User Experience Designer and with Figma as my preference for software, learning front end tools will make it possible for me to take full advantage of their Dev Mode. 

## Personal
*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧I love using Notion to manage life, and Dribble for inspiration. 
In my free time, I love weightlifting, traveling, watching anime and movies, hiking, and I have an interest in Greek Mythology. *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧

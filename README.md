### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![Header](./header.png)

âœ¾ I'm graduating May 2024 with my Bachelor of Science in Human Systems Engineering with a User Experience concentration âœ¾ and I've gotten more interested in front-end development throughout my classes. 
I am new to HTML and CSS but am learning a lot and am excited at the idea of the possibility of learning new languages.  I want to be a User Experience Designer and with Figma as my preference for software, learning front end tools will make it possible for me to take full advantage of their Dev Mode. 

*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§I love using Notion to manage life, and Dribble for inspiration. 
In my free time, I love weightlifting, traveling, watching anime and movies, hiking, and I have an interest in Greek Mythology. *:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§
